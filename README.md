# AddSub
* Detect additions and subtractions to Florida's state voter rolls.
* Compute demographic statistics on the changes
* Generate CSV output with results

This simple set of code is designed to allow you to determine who has been added or
subtracted from the voter rolls by comparing the full list from month to month.

There is a set of sample code that shows how you can also detect changes in a specific
party's registration or in a particular racial category.

You can download historical sets of Florida voter lists from [here](http://flvoters.com/downloads.html).

This is written in python version 3.5.  Only standard libraries are used.
